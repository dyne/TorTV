TorTV is a build of Tor maintained to run on TV devices and set-top
boxes, so that anyone with such an household appliance can contribute
to strengthen the Tor network.

Easy to deploy user downloads are provided, as well some developer
documentation and mostly the code used: TorTV does not reimplements
nor modifies the Tor source code in any way, it just provides binaries
for embedded targets and some scripting to facilitate ease of
installation.

TorTV just started to be developed and is in ALPHA stage: it consists
of an ad-hoc build (app.bin) and installation instructions for the
popular WD TV device series running the WDLXTV firmware (MIPS
based). If this project receives enough support and attention it will
eventually grow to maintain Tor builds for more MIPS and ARM based
devices.
